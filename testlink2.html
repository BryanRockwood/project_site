		<p> You're probably wondering - who is this mysterious person creating a website built around the practice of building websites? Why is he doing this and what's the end game of it all? Well take a seat and stay a while. It's story time </p>
		<br>
		<p> Your good friend Bryan went to school with dreams and aspirations of joining the game industry. Video games of all shapes and sizes were incredibly interesting to me. I started to learn more about the process of game design and computing as a whole. I took a web design course back in high school which helped give me a, albeit a small, look into devlopment. It's really funny to say that this one class pushed my into the computer science field, but everyone has to start somewhere right? Hell I even got to create a game! I added it to Kongregate and everything! </p>

	<br>
	<p> Heading into college I figured I'd need some Computer Science degree at the end of it all, just in case game design wouldn't work out for me. Strangely enough, my CS classes were some of my worst grades throughout college. It was always something I kind of understand, but often times struggled to really reach that next level to where I could create answers without having to ask for help or look up basic stntax. Luckily I was friends with some of the best engineers in our grade, and I bothered them relentless in order to scrape through the years. But I made it through, fumbled my way through some interviews, and found myself down in North Carolina for a coding bootcamp. Despite all the trials and tribulations (all self-inflicted, I fell asleep in class a bunch) I fought through in school, I ended up not needing the majority of it as I accepted a role in mainframe development. Oh yeah that's right - I was a 22 year old learning COBOL for work. 2 Months of additonal schooling later, and I was finally at a desk job in New Jersey</p>
	<br>
	 <p> Fast forward seven years and we made it to today. Still here, still working on maifnrame projects and trying to figure out what's next for me.
