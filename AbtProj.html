					This project is my version of the good old "3 Month Coding bootcamp" path that many developers go through when they are looking to make a career change. My plan is to continually improve and add to this site as I learn more topics around frontend (front-end?) development. I want this to be a sort of "living" website where it evolves as I do as a developer. Right now it's close to a blank canvas with some scribbles on it. In time i'll add some color to those scribbles, and eventually connect all those lines to make a more coherent picture. In a perfect version of this, I'll send people to this website to be my portfolio of work, and serve as a visual representation of my growth in this frontend journey. 
				</p>

					It wouldn't be a website without some basic HTML and CSS to lead the way. The first landing page here is all just handcrafted, farm fresh HTML from yours truly. You can probably tell there isn't much going on behind the scenes in the first few pages, and that's exactly my intention. Personally I like a cleaner, simpler look to things. Less eye clutter and more focus on the good stuff. The content, if you will. 
				</p>

					Next I have for you chef is the JavaSript portion of the web portfolio. In it you'll see me really try to create some more functional tools and features you may find on an everyday website. You don't really see a ball that grows in size the longer you have your mouse on it. And because It's my site and I can do what I want, these pages are going to be focused on fantasy football. Spoiler: I started this project in early October, so football is at the top of my brain.
