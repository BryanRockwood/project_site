				<h2 id ="mid_body_header"> Player Comparison tool</h2>
				<p>I'm a big fantasy football guy. I love talking about the game, the players, and how unfair of a game it ultimately is. Below is one of the main tools I've wanted to create to help not only myself, but to potentially help other people getting into the weeds of fantasy football. Here is the evolving progression of my player comparison tool. 
				</p>
				<br>
				<p> 
					First, I have a small scrpit that takes in two players and compares them against each other. At the moment I am simply using an array of values to serve as our data, and this tool searches the array for the two names and compares their "ranking" (read: index in the array) and returns the lower value of the two. Since rankings we usually want the "Number 1" option, we are looking for the lower number of the indices. This initial version contains just a few names to test out functionality. 
				</p>
				<script src="playersearch.js"></script>
				<div class="search_field">

						Find a player..
					<input type="text" id="playerA" placeholder="Search for a Player..">
					vs. 
					<input type="text" id="playerB" placeholder="Search for a Second Player..">
					<button type="button" onclick="playerCompare()"> Compare</button>
	
				</div>
				<div id="results">
					<p id="AinputResult"></p> 
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>This next version of the tool allows the user to select a player after typing in the first few letters of their name. That's right, it's an auto-complete feature!
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<script src="autocomplete.js"></script>
				<div class="search_field">

						Find a player..
					<input type="text" id="playerAAuto" placeholder="Search for a Player..">
					vs. 
					<input type="text" id="playerBAuto" placeholder="Search for a Second Player..">
					<button type="button" onclick="autocompleteSearch()"> Compare</button>
	
				</div>
				<div id="resultsAC">
